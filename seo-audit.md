SEO Audit:
	Indexation:
		- Check site:domain for obvious signs of indexation problems (eg. excess directories, indexing tag pages, etc)
		- Crawl the site using [Screaming Frog](http://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/)
		- Check site is setup in Google Search Console
		- Check any 4 or 500 errors and ensure others are working correctly (301s, etc.)
		- Check robots.txt to see what's being blocked and to see if it's being done correctly
		- Check if an XML sitemap exists
		- Is the sitemap submitted to Google and Bing?
	Content:
	- Run the [W3C Validator](http://validator.w3.org/) - not of huge important but could affect rankings if there are too many errors
	- Use [Pingdom](http://tools.pingdom.com/) and [Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights_extensions) to look at page speed
	- Check for duplicate content
	- Check pages are keyword focused and check for keyword stuffing or over opimisation
	- Is a blog or other form of content publishing happening?
	- Check hierachy in flow of pages 
	On-page elements:
	- URL structure
	- Title tag
	- Meta description
	- Headings
	- Internal linking
	- Quality content
	- Images (file names and alt tags)
	- Broken links
	Basic link analysis:
	- How many root domains are linking to the site?
	- How authoritative are those domains?
	- What is the root domain to total links count?
	- Do links come from diverse origins? Images, text, etc.
	- Is anchor text diversified, or significantly over optimized? A healthy mix of naked URLs, branded, and misc anchor text, are characteristics of a healthy link profile.
	- Competitor link analysis
